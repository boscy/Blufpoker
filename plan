## GAME MECHANICS ##
- Include having dice 'open' and 'closed' -> Done, public knowledge added after every roll
- Whichever die is not thrown must be open
        - Extend this with the possibility to keep dice closed and throw open?
- Calculate probabilities in terms of likelihood of throwing dice
- When deciding to call a bluff or believe, determine the chance how likely the possibility is among possible worlds


## LOGIC ##
- Make Kripke model:
   - Update after every dice throw and
   - when an agent sees the cup
- Kripke model in terms of States, valuations and relations


## RESULTS & CONCLUSION &&
- Performance of (knowledge) agent strategies amongst others
